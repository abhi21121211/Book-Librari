# Book Library GraphQL API

Welcome to the Book Library GraphQL API! This API allows you to manage books and users within a library system. You can register users, login/logout, add new books, browse available books, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Book Library GraphQL API, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd book-library-graphql
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/book-library
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```

   Replace `your-secret-key` with your own secret key for JWT token encryption.

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.
